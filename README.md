# laravel-todo
This project represents a Laravel package/module that will offer functionality for a *task management* application like **ToDo** and **Getting Things Done** built on latest Laravel LTS release which is v5.5 at the moment.  

### Story
It lets you create new tasks, edit them, delete them for yourself or another user. You can also reassign them to another user anytime. Tasks can be in various stages like *idle*, *started* (0%), *25-75% progress*, *completed/done* (100%), *aborted*, *scheduled*, *on hold*. There can also be a due-date assigned to a task that will show up in the task list. The task list shows all tasks of the user or all tasks of all users. A user can only modify his own tasks. The task-admin is a super-user that can manage all tasks of anyone.

## Technical requirements
* Laravel (*PHP*) v5.5 LTS
* Vue.js (*JS*) >= 2.5.13
* Bootstrap v4 (basic CSS only)
* MySQL (*SQL*) >= v5.7
